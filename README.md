# User List Application

A list of users is retrieved and shown by this Vite-built responsive React application from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). It offers each user a detailed view, search, and sorting capabilities. A spinner from react-loader-spinner appears while loading, and Axios is utilized for data fetching.


## Features

- **User List:** Display names and emails.
- **Details:** Click a name to view more info.
- **Search & Sort:** Filter by name/email and sort results.
- **Responsive:** Works on both mobile and desktop.
- **Error Handling:** Shows error messages with a retry option.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` (use `--legacy-peer-deps` if necessary).
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`.
